# Tableau-Data
Tableau dashboards in HR Analytics serve as interactive, visual tools that consolidate and present workforce data in a comprehensible format. These dashboards enable HR professionals to monitor key metrics such as employee headcount, attrition rates, recruitment pipeline, diversity statistics, and performance trends. With Tableau’s drag-and-drop interface and powerful data integration capabilities, users can connect multiple data sources, apply filters, and drill down into specific insights. The dashboards support strategic decision-making by offering real-time visibility into HR operations, enabling faster identification of issues and opportunities. Rich visual elements—like bar charts, heat maps, KPIs, and trend lines—make complex data easy to interpret at a glance.
